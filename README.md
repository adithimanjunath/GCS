# Cloud Storage Management System

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cloud Storage Management System project repository! 

This project was developed as part of the Advanced Computer Science subject and focuses on enabling users to interact seamlessly with Google Cloud Storage. 
The system allows users to perform various operations such as uploading files from local storage to cloud buckets, deleting files in cloud storage,retrieving files to local environments,and reading file contents from the application interface.

## Technologies Used

This project was developed using the following technologies in VS Code:

- **Python**: Used for backend development.
- **Flask**: A Python web framework used for building the web application.
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Used for client-side scripting to enhance user interactions.

## Key Features

The Cloud Storage Management System offers the following key features:

1. **File Upload**: Users can upload files from their local storage to cloud buckets.
2. **File Deletion**: Users can delete files stored in cloud storage.
3. **File Retrieval**: Users can retrieve files from cloud storage to their local environments.
4. **File Content Viewing**: Users can view the contents of files directly from the application interface.

## Project Objectives

- Enable seamless interaction with Google Cloud Storage.
- Implement essential functionalities for managing files in cloud storage.
- Deepen understanding of cloud technologies and web development frameworks.
- Gain practical experience in building scalable and user-friendly cloud-based applications.
